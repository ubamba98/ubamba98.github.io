I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon, where I work on multi-modal representation learning and large language models. Prior to Amazon, I was a Research Intern at Mila - Quebec AI Institute and earned my Integrated Master's degree from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>model compression, efficient training and inference, and multi-modal representation learning</em>.

Beyond academic research, I am an active competitor in machine learning competitions on Kaggle, where I hold rank of Competitions Master with five gold and eight silver medals. When I'm not brainstorming ideas or coding, I enjoy gaming, watching movies, and engaging in detailed discussions about them.
