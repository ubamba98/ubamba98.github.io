I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon, where I work at the intersection of large language models and low-latency on-device inference. Beyond my industry role, I actively mentor students and collaborate with researchers. Prior to Amazon, I focused on resource-efficient machine learning as an intern at Mila - Quebec AI Institute and co-founded Transmute AI Labs to mentor underrepresented students at IIT Dhanbad. 

These days I am working on building better mixture-of-experts systems and helping LLMs reason efficiently under strict compute budgets. Beyond academic research, I am an active competitor on Kaggle, where I hold the Competitions Master title with five gold and eight silver medals. Apart from work, I enjoy gaming, binge-watching shows, and playing badminton.
