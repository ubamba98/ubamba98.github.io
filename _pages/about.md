I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon, where I work on data efficiency and multi-modal representation learning. Prior to Amazon, I worked as a Research Intern at Mila - Quebec AI Institute and earned my Integrated Master's degree from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>efficient deep learning and multi-modal representation learning</em>.

Beyond academic research, I am an active competitor on Kaggle, where I hold Competitions Master title with five gold and eight silver medals. Apart from work, I enjoy gaming, bing watching shows, and playing badminton.
